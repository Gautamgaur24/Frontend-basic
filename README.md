# Frontend-basic
This frontend UI displays a "Bundle &amp; Save" offer where users can choose between 1, 2, or 3 pairs at discounted prices. Each option clearly shows the original price, discounted price, and percentage off. The total price updates dynamically, and users can add their selection to the cart with a single click.
